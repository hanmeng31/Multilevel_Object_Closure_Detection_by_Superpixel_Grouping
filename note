This programm can be run on Matlab_2014/2017 or identical versions.

Compared with the original source, we made some changes below:

1. For the mainfunction ./Multilevel-Object-Closure-Detection-By-Superpixels/ClosureMain.m, we generate name-specific file automatically to store related files.
2. At the stage of computing superpixels:
    For "ncuts" method, we changed the ./Multilevel-Object-Closure-Detection-By-Superpixels/Ncut_9/eigs_new.m with the eigs.m from Matlab_2014.
3. We changed /Multilevel-Object-Closure-Detection-By-Superpixels/ChooseLargestSupComponent.m to solve some bugs in special cases when we choose all the superpixels.
